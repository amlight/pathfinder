    CHANGE A LOT ON THE NEXT FEW DAYS/WEEKS, USE IT AT YOUR OWN DISCERNMENT

The NApp **kytos/pathfinder** is a NApp responsible for creating a graph with
the latest network topology and providing rest endpoint to calculate the best
path between two devices. In the network, each device is a host or a switch and
each link is a connection between two devices. In the graph, each device
represents a node and each link represents an edge between two nodes.

The NApp learns custom properties from the topology, being able to define the
best paths based on a weighted parameter. Please see the Rest API documentation
for details.
